  <title>Introduction</title>

   <para id="introduction-section">On January 30, 2009, a workshop was held to assess qualitatively the NSF-funded project GERESE, Graduate Education in Research Ethics for Scientists and Engineers.  (NSF 0629377)  This module has the umbrella presentation introducing the different activities, a presentation on the theoretical and historical background of research ethics, presentations used in two student workshops, General Awareness Workshop and Moral Deliberation Workshop.  At this stage, this module exists as a resource participants can use to access these workshop materials.  At a later stage, it will be expanded to provide a toolkit other institutions can use for developing their own assessment workshops.</para>
